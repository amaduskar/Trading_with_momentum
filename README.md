Momentum is the rate of acceleration of a security's priceâ€”that is, the speed at which the price is changing. Momentum trading is a strategy that seeks to capitalize on momentum to enter a trend as it is picking up steam.

Simply put, momentum refers to the inertia of a price trend to continue either rising or falling for a particular length of time, usually taking into account both price and volume information. In technical analysis, momentum is often measured via an oscillator and is used to help identify trends.

Investors can use momentum as a trading technique that seeks to profit off the herding behavior of market psychology. Rather than "buy low, sell high", momentum trading follows a strategy of "buy high, sell higher". Once a momentum trader sees acceleration in a stock's price, earnings or revenues, the trader will often take a long or short position in the stock in the hope that its momentum will continue in either an upward or downward direction. This strategy relies on short-term movements in a stock's price rather than fundamental value.

In this project, I have attempted to assemble a long/short portfolio of stocks based on the momentum indicator. Based off the dataset, the monthly 'n' top performing stocks would go into the long portfolio to be bought into while the bottom 'n' stocks would go into the short portfolio to be shorted.

At the end of the project, I used hypothesis testing in order to determine the viability of this strategy. The results are at the very end of the jupyter notebook in this repository.
